## 3. Functional requirements

Each sub-section lists: **inputs**, **behaviour**, **acceptance
criteria**. All writes enforce the role/scope rules from §2.3 and the
compliance rules from §9. Wording like "Today ± 2 days" is from the
onboarding doc; keep parity unless Part 3 redesigns the flow.

### 3.1 Authentication

#### 3.1.1 Login
- **Inputs**: user ID, password, network-mode selector
  (`online` / `offline`).
- **Behaviour**:
  - `online`: credentials POST to `/auth/login` → session token in
    KV → redirect to Home.
  - `offline`: validates against the last successful-login credential
    blob cached in IndexedDB (hashed, salted with device secret).
    Offline sessions are scope-limited to offline-capable workflows
    (§3.7).
  - Eye icon toggles password visibility.
- **Acceptance**:
  - 3 consecutive wrong attempts ⇒ account locked; further tries
    return a lockout message regardless of credential correctness.
  - Lock is released only via OTP reset (§3.1.3).
  - Online-mode login failure when device is offline shows a clear
    "You are offline — switch to Offline mode" message (not a
    generic network error).

#### 3.1.2 Forced password change on default password
- **Trigger**: session's user has `password_is_default = 1`.
- **Behaviour**: after login, route the user to `/change-pwd` with
  back navigation disabled. The onboarding doc instructs users to
  re-enter `TEST*1234` on first change; **our bespoke flow rejects
  that** and requires a new password meeting policy (min 8 chars,
  1 upper, 1 digit, 1 symbol).
- **Acceptance**: no authenticated route other than `/change-pwd` and
  `/auth/logout` is reachable until the password is changed.

#### 3.1.3 OTP reset / account unlock
- **Inputs**: user ID, delivery channel (email or SMS).
- **Behaviour**: POST `/auth/otp/request` issues a 6-digit code,
  stored in KV with a 10-minute TTL and max 5 verify attempts. POST
  `/auth/otp/verify` consumes it and opens a one-time password-set
  window.
- **Acceptance**:
  - Request rate-limited: max 3 OTPs per user per hour.
  - Successful reset clears the lockout and invalidates all existing
    sessions.

#### 3.1.4 Logout
- POST `/auth/logout` deletes the KV session and clears client state.

### 3.2 Children (student master)

#### 3.2.1 List and pick a village
- Home → **Children** → village list scoped to §2.3.
- Tapping a village opens the student list for that village, with
  the `+` FAB to add a new child.

#### 3.2.2 Add child
- **Required fields**: first name, last name, gender, DOB, school
  (picker), village (pre-filled from context, editable within scope),
  program join date, photo.
- **Parent fields** (at least one parent required):
  - Father: name, Aadhaar (optional), phone.
  - Mother: name, Aadhaar (optional), phone.
  - Smartphone flag per phone number.
  - If neither parent has a smartphone: **alternate contact**
    (phone + relationship label) becomes required.
- **Forbidden field**: child Aadhaar is not present in the form or
  schema (§9.1).
- **Behaviour**: client validation → POST `/api/children` →
  success toast. Photo uploads via R2 presigned URL (§7), row
  references the object key.
- **Acceptance**:
  - All required fields enforced client-side and server-side.
  - On submit, the child appears in the village list immediately
    (optimistic add, rollback on server error).

#### 3.2.3 Edit child
- From the student detail screen → **Edit**.
- Same validation as add; photo replacement is optional.

#### 3.2.4 Graduate child
- From the student detail screen → scroll to **Graduate** →
  graduation date + reason (enum: `Pass Out`, later-extensible).
- On success, the child's name renders in black-and-white in the
  village list (visual parity with the vendor app).
- **Acceptance**: graduated children are excluded from attendance
  lists for sessions on dates > graduation date.

---

### 3.3 Attendance

#### 3.3.1 Start a session
- Home → **Attendance** → date picker (default today; allowed range:
  today, today-1, today-2; reject anything else).
- Village picker (scope-bound). Start time, end time (24h, end ≥
  start).
- Event picker (from active events for that village). Optional voice
  note (audio blob uploaded to R2).

#### 3.3.2 Mark attendance
- Checkbox list of active (non-graduated) students for the chosen
  village and date.
- Submit posts one row per student with `present = true|false`.
- Village chip in the home screen turns **green** for the selected
  date on success.

#### 3.3.3 Acceptance
- Duplicate submission for the same `(village, date, event)` replaces
  the prior list and bumps `updated_at/by`; server returns the new
  record IDs.
- Offline submissions (§3.7) carry the local capture timestamp and
  are reconciled server-side.
- A VC cannot pick a date > today.

---

### 3.4 Capture image / video

#### 3.4.1 Capture
- Home → **Capture Video and Photo** → camera or video recorder.
- On capture, the app extracts EXIF GPS from the source file (or
  uses `navigator.geolocation` as a fallback) and stores it alongside
  the media record.

#### 3.4.2 Tag
Before upload, each item must be tagged as exactly one of:
- **Tag Event** — for Annual Competition (AC) or Special Event.
  Choose an event from the events master.
- **Tag Activity** — for daily activities (Board Games, Running Race,
  Kho-Kho, Kabaddi, Prakriti Prem, Dhan Kaushal, Jal Vriddhi, No
  Activity — Raining, No Activity — Training, …). Choose from the
  activity master.

#### 3.4.3 Upload
- Single-item upload via the cloud icon; the item disappears from
  the local queue on server ack.
- **AF-and-above**: on upload, the app prompts to pick the village
  to attribute the media to (AFs cover multiple villages). VCs skip
  this step — their village is implicit.
- Large videos use R2 multipart with resumable uploads (§7).

#### 3.4.4 Acceptance
- Every uploaded item has: media object key, tag kind (`event` /
  `activity`), event/activity FK, village FK, capture timestamp, GPS
  lat/lng (if available), uploader user ID.
- Media that fails upload stays in the local queue until success or
  manual delete.

### 3.5 Achievements

- Home → **Achievements** → list scoped to §2.3 → `+` FAB.
- Fields: student (picker, scope-bound), description (free text,
  max 500 chars), date, type.
- **Type = SoM (Star of the Month)**: description only. One SoM per
  student per month — a second SoM for the same month updates the
  existing row.
- **Type = Gold | Silver**: prompt for medal counts (integers ≥ 1)
  as additional fields.
- Acceptance: the dashboard's SoM counts (§3.6) reflect a new SoM
  within one refresh cycle.

---

### 3.6 Dashboards

#### 3.6.1 Drill-down dashboard
- 5 top-level tiles: **Village Coordinators**, **Area Facilitators**,
  **Children**, **Attendance**, **Achievements** (the vendor's fifth
  tile "Locations" is a drill-in starter — we fold it into each
  metric).
- Picking a metric opens India → Zone → State → Region → District →
  Cluster → Village drill (§2.2).
- Each level renders a table with the metric value and an **Excel
  download** button; tapping a row drills to the next level.
- **Acceptance**: the leaf (village) level shows per-student detail
  for Children; per-session rows for Attendance; per-award rows for
  Achievements.

#### 3.6.2 Consolidated dashboard
- Date selector: **single day** or **range** (two date icons in the
  green header strip, per the onboarding doc).
- Cluster picker (scope-bound).
- Metrics for the selection: attendance %, average children,
  image % / video % (uploads vs expected), SoM current vs previous
  month, bar chart.
- **View More** drills to per-village rows within the chosen cluster.

#### 3.6.3 Acceptance
- Excel export mirrors the on-screen table exactly (same columns,
  same order, same filter).
- A District+ admin cannot see another district's data (enforced
  server-side).

---

### 3.7 Offline mode

Detailed sync architecture is in Part 4; this section lists the
user-facing contract.

- Offline mode supports only: **Attendance**, **Achievements**,
  **Capture Image / Video**. Other menu items are hidden or
  disabled with a tooltip.
- Actions queue in an IndexedDB outbox. The home screen shows an
  outbox badge with pending count.
- On reconnect, the user goes online (re-login if needed) → Home →
  **Upload Offline Data**. Each queued item shows status
  (`pending` / `uploading` / `done` / `error`). The cloud icon
  top-right uploads all pending items; per-item retry on error.
- **Acceptance**:
  - Queued items survive app restart and device reboot.
  - A successful upload removes the item from the outbox.
  - An item that fails 5 times surfaces an error banner; it stays
    in the queue until resolved by the user (retry or delete).
  - Clock skew is tolerated: the server trusts the client's
    `captured_at` timestamp but stamps its own `received_at`.

---

### 3.8 Secondary screens

Parity with the vendor app; keep them minimal.

#### 3.8.1 Profile
- Read-only: name, user ID, date of joining, role, assigned geo
  scope. Link: "Report an error" (opens a prefilled email to the
  user's AF).

#### 3.8.2 Notice board
- List of notices (title, body, posted-by, posted-on), most-recent
  first. Scope-filtered (a notice can be global, zone-wide,
  state-wide, … down to village).
- Super Admins and scoped admins can post new notices within their
  scope.

#### 3.8.3 About Us
- Static content, editable by Super Admin. Versioned (show
  last-updated date).

#### 3.8.4 Reference links
- Curated external links (e.g. government schemes, training
  material). Fields: title, url, description, category.

#### 3.8.5 Quick Phone / Quick Video links
- Quick Phone: one-tap dial entries (role, name, phone). Quick
  Video: embedded or linked training videos.
- Managed by Super Admin.

#### 3.8.6 Language switcher
- In the side menu. Persists per user (both in KV session and in
  `localStorage` for offline). Default set: en + kn + ta (confirm
  §9.6).

#### 3.8.7 Master Creations (Super Admin only)
- Consolidated CRUD for each master (villages, schools, events,
  activities, qualifications, roles, reference links, quick links,
  notices, users, retention settings). Not a generic table editor —
  one dedicated screen per master, with only the fields the bespoke
  app actually uses.
